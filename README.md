# Virtual Currency Game

This is a virtual currency game made with `Next.js`; inspired by those games of classical discord bots like Dank Memer, OwO, CashBot, etc. But i the game has a twist - **Your balance mysteriosly decreases over time!** Continue reading to find out.

> ‚ùï‚ùó Try reading this file carefully; otherwise you might rage in the game!

## Features

1. **Your Balance is of two types.** One is the "wallet", and the other is in the "bank". 



2. **You can Deposit/Withdraw money.** 
    - **Withdrawing** lets you transfer money from "bank" to "wallet"
    - **Depositing** lets you transfer money from "wallet" to "bank"



3. **You can earn coins.** The game offers you three methods of earning:
    - **Flip a Coin:** To have a 50-50 chance of winning or losing 2x the amount of input value

    - **Slot Machine:** To have a 25% chance of winning/losing 5x the amount of input value

    - **Begging:** When luck isn't on your side, collect money by this way! (Max. beg amount is 500 at a time)



4. **The UI is intuitive.** 
    - On the top-center of the screen, you can view your balances.
    - The game screen provides you a graph to visualize your balances!
    - You're also provided a transaction history that you develop with the progress in game.
    - You're provided 3 modes of earning currency as mentioned above
    - You can deposit/withdraw currency as described above.


## Dysfunctionality 

Your **wallet balance** is in danger. Some portion of your wallet's balance gets robbed mysteriously at a fixed time interval, so make sure to:

- Continuously deposit your winnings in bank, or you may lose your wallet money upto even 90-100%!

## Why there's no backend?

If you see the first commit, there used to have a `backend` folder in the root directory. It's not present anymore, because:

- My motive was to make the game multiplayer aswell. But I changed my mind. 

- Even for a singleplayer game, requiring an entire backend seems to overkill the task!


## The End of the file

I hope you liked the project! Consider giving a star üåü to the repository.
